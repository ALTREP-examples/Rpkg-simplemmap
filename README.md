# The simplemmap Package

This package will provide a package implementation of memory-mapped
vectors as a simple illustration of the package support in the
`ALTREP` mechanism to be added to R, initially in a branch named
`ALTREP`.  Code is shared with the code for the base implementation in
'src/main/altrep.c'.
