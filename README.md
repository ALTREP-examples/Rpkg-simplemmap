# The simplemmap Package

This package will provide a package implementation of memory-mapped
vectors as a simple illustration of the package support in the
`ALTREP` mechanism to be added to R, initially available in the
[`ALTREP` branch](https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/ALTREP).  Code
is shared with the code for the base implementation in
'src/main/altrep.c'.
